# Web-Scraper-and-Regression-Project

# This is my first data science project ever. This project takes great inspiration from the series Data Science Project from Scratch of Ken Jee - a famous Data Scientist and Youtube Content Creator. This project could not ever be done without thorough and detailed explanations in his video series. For more details, please see Ken Jee and his playlists on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpF9HENQjDo&list=PL2zq7klxX5ASFejJj80ob9ZAnBHdz5O1t&t=0s

There are 3 main parts in this projects:
- Data Scraping
- Data Processing and Exploratory Analysis
- Data Modelling and Deployment
With each part, you can find the associated file:
- Data Scraping: 
  - web_scraper.py: This is where I wrote the function to scrape the data from Glassdoor. This function was greatly adapted from a GitHub user's selenium scraping function: https://github.com/arapfaik/scraping-glassdoor-selenium
  - data_collection.py: This is where the data was collected.
  
- Data Processing and Exploratory Analysis

  - Notebooks: data_cleaning.ipynb and data_eda.ipynb
  
- Data Modelling and Deployment
  - Data files: test_data.csv
  - Notebooks: model_building.ipynb
  - Model file: prediction_model.p
  - Deployment file: model_production.py
